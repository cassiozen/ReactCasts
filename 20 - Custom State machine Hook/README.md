# Custom State Machine Hook

In this episode, we will implement a State Machine in React using useReducer and useEffect. We will follow the same basic configuration format used by XState and implement enough features to run the previous video sample code without changes.
With that done, we will explore how we can make it follow more idiomatic react patterns (Since it's built on top of React, might as well...).

Ah, and if you use TypeScript, there is a bonus at the end of the video.
