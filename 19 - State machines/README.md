# State Machines

So I've been thinking about doing a state machines video for quite a long time and I think that now is the moment because state machines have seen some soaring popularity in frontend development (mostly because of the great work David K piano has been doing with the Xstate library).

And it's funny because state machines are extremely popular in other software development areas such as game development and embedded systems.

In this video you will learn why state machines are important, and a small example using the XState library.
